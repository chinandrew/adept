This vignette provides an example of walking stride segmentation from subsecond accelerometry data with `adept` package. We demonstrate that ADEPT method ([1]) can be used to perform automatic and precise walking stride segmentation from data collected during a combination of running, walking and resting exercise. We demonstrate how to segment data: 

i. with the use of stride templates that were pre-computed based on data from an external study, 
ii. by deriving new stride templates in a semi-manual manner. 

See [Introduction to adept package](https://martakarass.github.io/adept/articles/adept-intro.html) vignette for an introduction to the ADEPT method and usage examples of the `segmentPattern` function which implements the ADEPT method.

# Raw accelerometry data sample

The `adept` package comes with `acc_running` data - a sample of raw accelerometry data collected during 25 minutes of an outdoor run. Data were collected at frequency 100 Hz with two ActiGraph GT9X Link sensors located at left hip and left ankle. 

### Running trial

*mapmyrun* mobile tracking application ([link](mapmyrun.com)) was used during 25 minutes of run corresponding to `acc_running` accelerometry data set. Based on the app, the distance covered is approximately 3.35 km. A ground elevation plot from the app output indicates some trial signatures, including an uphill part on the north side of the Patterson Park in Baltimore, MD. The `acc_running` data sample is a subset of accelerometry data collected over a few days time; the sample attached should match the time while an app was turned on up to ~1-minute accuracy.

### Sensor and accelerometry data

The data were collected with two ActiGraph GT9X Link sensors at frequency 100 Hz. [ActiGraph GT9X Link](https://www.actigraphcorp.com/actigraph-link/) is an activity monitor which includes 3-axis accelerometer measuring body acceleration along three orthogonal axes. At frequency 100 Hz, 100 observations are collected each second, where each observation consists of 3 data points (one data point from each of three orthogonal axes), yielding a total of 300 data points per second.  

### Sensor location

One of the sensors was attached to the shoe with a clip on the outside side of a left foot, just below the left ankle. The other sensor was attached to the elastic belt located at the hip, on the left side of a hip. Both devices stayed in a fairly stable way during the run.

### Data set `acc_running`

The sample accelerometry data is attached to the package as `acc_running` data frame. To access the data, load  `adept` package. 

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("martakarass/adept")
library(adept)
library(lubridate)
options(digits.secs = 2)
head(acc_running)
tz(acc_running$date_time)
```

`acc_running` consists of 300,000 observations of 5 variables:

* `x` - acceleration measurement time series collected from a $x$-axis of the sensor accelerometer,
* `y` - acceleration measurement time series collected from a $y$-axis of the sensor accelerometer,
* `x` - acceleration measurement time series collected from a $z$-axis of the sensor accelerometer,
* `vm` - vector magnitude of $(x,y,z)$ vector of measurements, computed as $vm = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$,
* `date_time` - date and time of acceleration measurement collection stored as `POSIXct`,
* `sensor_location` - sensor location label, one of: `"left_hip"`, `"left_ankle"`.


##### Note on `date_time` column values

* Seemingly, there is an error in `date_time` column: we would expect its second value to be `17:57:30.01`, not: `17:57:30.00`. Values in `date_time` column were generated via `seq(from = as.POSIXct("2018-10-25 17:57:30.00", tz = "UTC"), by = 0.01, length.out = 150000)`. I identify the problem to be the floating point arithmetic problem, as discussed in [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11571105/odd-behavor-with-posixct-posixlt-and-subsecond-accuracy). Such errors are "made up for" over the column values, and the whole `date_time` has expected range of time. 

Time collection spans 25 minutes. It agrees with a number of observations per sensor we have (`150000`), given the data was collected at frequency 100 observations per second. 
```{r}
range(acc_running$date_time)
table(acc_running$sensor_location)
150000 / (100 * 60)  
```

# Accelerometry data visualization

### Raw accelerometry data 

One way to visualize raw accelerometry data is to plot it as a three-dimensional time-series $(x,y,z)$. Here, we plot data from three different time frames, each of 4 seconds length, simultaneously for data collected at left ankle and right ankle. 

```{r plot_xyz, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4.5}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(gridExtra)

## Define time frame start values for data subset
t1 <- ymd_hms("2018-10-25 18:07:00", tz = "UTC") 
t2 <- ymd_hms("2018-10-25 18:20:30", tz = "UTC") 
t3 <- ymd_hms("2018-10-25 18:22:00", tz = "UTC") 

## Subset data 
acc_running_sub <- 
  acc_running %>%
  filter((date_time >= t1 & date_time < t1 + as.period(4, "seconds")) | 
           (date_time >= t2 & date_time < t2 + as.period(4, "seconds")) | 
           (date_time >= t3 & date_time < t3 + as.period(4, "seconds")) )

## Plot (x,y,z) values 
acc_running_sub %>%
  select(-vm) %>%
  melt(id.vars = c("date_time", "sensor_location")) %>%
  mutate(dt_floor = paste0("time frame start: ", 
                           floor_date(date_time, unit = "minutes"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_time, y = value, color = variable)) + 
  geom_line(size = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(sensor_location ~ dt_floor, scales = "free_x") + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 9) + 
  labs(x = "Time [s]", y = "Acceleration [g]", color = "Accelerometer axis of measurement: ",
       title = "Raw accelerometry data (x,y,z)") + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```

##### Note on sensors desynchronization 

* The two sensors used in experiment were set up to initialize their measurement collection at the same time. However, as discussed in [2], even when simultaneous initialization of the devices is used, measurements might still get desynchronized between devices after hours and/or days of data collection. For that possible reason, one should not expect 0.01 second-level alignment between the data collected form left ankle and left hip on the plots above.    


### Vector magnitude 

Using vector magnitude $(vm)$ is a way to summarize a three-dimensional time-series $(x,y,z)$ as a one-dimensional time-series. Vector magnitude is computed as $vm = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ at each time point of data collection. 

```{r plot_vm, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4.1}
## Plot vector magnitude values 
acc_running_sub %>%
  mutate(dt_floor = paste0("time frame start: ", 
                           floor_date(date_time, unit = "minutes"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_time, y = vm)) + 
  geom_line(size = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(sensor_location ~ dt_floor, scales = "free_x") + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 9) + 
  labs(x = "Time [s]", y = "Vector magnitue [g]", 
       title = "Vector magnitude (vm) summary of raw accelerometry data") 
```

##### Observations 

From the $(x,y,z)$ and $(vm)$ plots we can tell the presence of an asymmetric repetitive pattern associated with each walking stride (stride := two subsequent steps): 

* On the $(vm)$ plot, the stride beginning and end are marked with a signal magnitude peak corresponding to a moment when the left feet heel hits the ground; between two such peaks, there are one/two smaller peaks, corresponding to the right feet contacting the ground. 

Also, there are differences in data magnitude and stride duration between the three vertical plot panels: 

* The left vertical plot panel (`time frame start: 2018-10-25 18:07:00`) corresponds to a slow/moderate pace running uphill; $(vm)$ time-series exhibits relatively high magnitude.

* The middle vertical plot panel (`time frame start: 2018-10-25 18:20:00`) corresponds to a relatively fast running; we can observe that $(vm)$ time-series exhibits high magnitude. Also, there are more stride patterns captured within this 4-seconds time frame than on the two other 4-seconds time frames, which suggests a higher ratio of strides per second performed by a runner. 

* The right vertical plot panel (`time frame start: 2018-10-25 18:22:00`) most likely corresponds to  walking; we can observe relatively low  $(vm)$ magnitude and a bit different shape of a stride pattern pronounced. 
 
 
### Vector magnitude count  

Clearly, it might be challenging to make a plot of *all* data points collected at frequency 100 Hz from 25 minutes-long exercise. A way to summarize accelerometry data of such high density is to use a $(vmc)$ - vector magnitude count (also known as the mean amplitude deviation). For $\overline{vm}(t,H)$ - average of $(vm)$ time-series over time window of length $H$ starting at time $t$, we define 
$$\mathrm { vmc } ( t, H ) = \frac { 1 } { H } \sum _ { h = 0 } ^ { H - 1 } \left| vm ( t + h ) - \overline{vm}(t,H) \right|.$$

```{r plot_vmc, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4.2}
## Function to compute vmc from a vm window vector
vmc <- function(vm.win){
  mean(abs(vm.win - mean(vm.win)))
}

## Compute vmc vector in 3-seconds windows 
vm <- acc_running$vm
win.vl <- 100 * 3
rn.seq <- seq(1, to = length(vm), by = win.vl)
vmc.vec <- sapply(rn.seq, function(rn.i){
  vm.win.idx <- rn.i : (rn.i + win.vl - 1)
  vm.win <- vm[vm.win.idx]
  vmc(vm.win)
})

vmc.df <- data.frame(vmc = vmc.vec,
                     date_time = acc_running$date_time[rn.seq],
                     rn_seq = rn.seq,
                     sensor_location = acc_running$sensor_location[rn.seq]) 
vmc.df.rest <- 
  vmc.df %>% 
  filter(sensor_location == "left_ankle") %>%
  mutate(resting = ifelse(vmc < 0.4, 1, 0),
         vmc_tau_i = rn_seq - 150000) %>%
  select(date_time, resting, vmc_tau_i)
vmc.df <- vmc.df %>% left_join(vmc.df.rest, by = "date_time")

## Plot vmc 
vmc.df %>%
  filter(date_time < max(acc_running$date_time) - 5, 
         date_time > min(acc_running$date_time) + 5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_time, y = vmc)) +
  facet_grid(sensor_location ~ .) + 
  geom_tile(aes(fill = factor(resting)),  height = Inf, alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_line(size = 0.3) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 9) + 
  labs(x = "Exercise time [min]", y = "Vector magnitue count",
       title = "Vector magnitude count (vmc) computed over 3 second-length windows of (vm)",
       fill = "Resting: ") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("white", "blue")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = "grey90"))
## Time percentage when (vmc) computed from left ankle is below 0.4
(vmc.low.frac <- mean(vmc.df.rest$resting))
```

##### Observations 

* We see that approx. 19\% of the time $(vmc)$ computed from left ankle data is below 0.4 value. Here, that part of data *likely* corresponds to standing with no walking/running legs movement involved; it may be that the runner was waiting on the crossroad for a green light to cross, or was being tired and hence was making breaks. We use this arbitrarily selected threshold of 0.4 to partition data into time frames of resting ($(vmc)<0.4$; marked with light blue color) and non-resting ($(vmc)\geq 0.4$). 

* On the contrary, high values of  $(vmc)$ correspond to high volumes of physical activity recorded; in this experiment, at approx. 18:21 (6:21 PM) a short (~1 minute) period of a fast run started, corresponding to particularly high values of $(vmc)$ recorded with both left ankle and left hip sensors.  

# Walking strides segmentation

To perform strides segmentation from $(vm)$ time-series, we need a stride pattern template that is specific to a sensor location that data were collected at. We are going to demonstrate two approaches: 

1. **Approach 1**: Use stride pattern templates attached to the `adept` package as `stride_template` object. These walking strides were derived from a set of manually pre-segmented strides from data collected in a different experiment, with different participants (see `?stride_template` for details). 

2. **Approach 2**: Derive stride pattern templates manually from `acc_running` data set.

### Smoothing parameter selection

The `segmentPattern` function algorithm has two phases in which a smoothed version of $(vm)$ time-series may be used: 

1. In computation of similarity matrix between pattern template and (possibly smoothed) $(vm)$ signal. Here, `x.adept.ma.W` argument of `segmentPattern` function defines a length of a window used in moving average smoothing; it is expressed in seconds. 

    For this phase, we recommend low/moderate smoothing (`x.adept.ma.W = 0.05`, `x.adept.ma.W = 0.15`) so as tiny $(vm)$ bumps are smoothed, but the overall $(vm)$ shape features are not lost. 

2. In "maxima" tuning procedure where local maxima of (possibly smoothed) $(vm)$ signal are identified as final beginnings and ends of a stride pattern occurrence. Here, `finetune.maxima.ma.W` argument of `segmentPattern` function defines a length of a window used in moving average smoothing; it is expressed in seconds. 

    For this phase, in case of a very clear signal and distinct signal local maxima, no smoothing may be used (`finetune.maxima.ma.W = NULL`); in case of low-signal and noisy data (i.e., often the case of data collected with a sensor located at wrist), high levels of smoothing (`finetune.maxima.ma.W = 0.3` or similar) may be used.
    
Function `windowSmooth {adept}` computes moving window average of a time-series `x` and may be used to experiment with different values of  smoothing window length `W` (expressed in seconds). Results of the exemplary choice of smoothing parameter `W` are presented below.  

```{r plot_vm_smoothed2, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.1}
## Use moving window average with a length of a window equal 0.05 s 
acc_running$vm_smoothed1 <- windowSmooth(x = acc_running$vm, x.fs = 100, W = 0.05)

acc_running %>%
  filter((date_time >= t1 & date_time < t1 + as.period(4, "seconds")) | 
           (date_time >= t2 & date_time < t2 + as.period(4, "seconds")) | 
           (date_time >= t3 & date_time < t3 + as.period(4, "seconds"))) %>%
  mutate(dt_floor = paste0("time frame start: ", 
                           floor_date(date_time, unit = "minutes"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date_time, y = vm_smoothed1)) + 
  geom_line(size = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(sensor_location ~ dt_floor, scales = "free_x") + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 9) + 
  labs(x = "Time [s]", y = "Vector magnitue [g]", color = "Axis: ",
       title = "Vector magnitude (vm) smoothed, length of smoothing window = 0.05 s") 
```


### Segmentation with *Approach 1*: use existing stride pattern templates

##### Left ankle

We first construct a `template` object; it is a list of left ankle-specific stride templates (due to movement symmetry, it could serve for right ankle same well!). Here, we use two precomputed templates (see `?stride_template` for details). 

```{r segm_la, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
template <- list(stride_template$left_ankle[[2]][1, ],
                 stride_template$left_ankle[[2]][2, ])
par(mfrow = c(1,2), cex = 0.7)
plot(template[[1]], type = "l", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Left ankle: template 1")
plot(template[[2]], type = "l", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Left ankle: template 2")
```

We perform strides segmentation from $(vm)$ accelerometry signal. Explanation of some of parameters used: 

* `x` - A $(vm)$ vector we segment pattern occurrences from. 
* `x.fs` - Frequency at which data is collected, expressed in a number of observations per second.
* `template` - A list of pattern templates. 
* `pattern.dur.seq` -  A grid of template scales considered in segmentation. Grid values are expressed in seconds of pattern duration time; their range is determined by what we consider plausible duration time for a pattern to take. In case of healthy adult person, 0.5-1.8 seconds range for a stride (:= two subsequent steps) seems reasonable; for data collected in elderly population, 0.5-2.25 seconds could be considered etc. (See: `Details` in `?segmentPattern`). 
* `finetune` - If set to `"maxima"`, a procedure is employed to tune preliminarily identified locations of pattern occurrence beginning and end so as they correspond to local maxima of $(vm)$. 
* `run.parallel` - Whether or not to use parallel execution in the algorithm. The `future` package is used to execute code asynchronously.

See `?segmentPattern` for detailed explanation of all method parameters. 

```{r segm_la2, eval = FALSE}
x.la <- acc_running$vm[acc_running$sensor_location == "left_ankle"]
out1.la <- segmentPattern(x = x.la,
                          x.fs = 100,
                          template = template,
                          pattern.dur.seq = seq(0.5, 1.8, length.out = 50),
                          similarity.measure = "cor",
                          x.adept.ma.W = 0.15,
                          finetune = "maxima",
                          finetune.maxima.ma.W = 0.05,
                          finetune.maxima.nbh.W = 0.2,
                          compute.template.idx = TRUE,
                          run.parallel = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval =  FALSE, include=FALSE}
# path.tmp <- "/Users/martakaras/Dropbox/_PROJECTS/R/adept/vignettes/static/results/out1_la.csv"
path.tmp <- "static/results/out1_la.csv"
write.csv(out1.la, path.tmp, row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r,  include=FALSE}
path.tmp <- "static/results/out1_la.csv"
x.la <- acc_running$vm[acc_running$sensor_location == "left_ankle"]
out1.la <- read.csv(path.tmp)
```

```{r}
head(out1.la)
```

Each row of the returned `data.frame` describes one identified pattern occurrence:

* `tau_i` -Index of a vector (here: $(vm)$ time-series) where an identified pattern occurrence starts.
* `T_i` - Duration of identified pattern occurrence, expressed in a vector length.
* `sim_i` - Value of similarity statistic between pattern template and a data signal (here: $(vm)$ time-series) where the pattern occurrence was identified (see `?segmentPattern` for details).
* `template_i` - If `compute.template.idx` equals `TRUE`: index of pattern template that had the best match with a data signal where the pattern occurrence was identified; otherwise: `NA`.

We now run segmentation on data collected at left hip. We then compare the results.

##### Left hip

Construct `template` object; it is a list of left hip-specific stride templates (again: due to movement symmetry, it could serve for right ankle same well!).
```{r segm_lh, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
template <- list(stride_template$left_hip[[1]][1, ],
                 stride_template$left_hip[[2]][2, ])
par(mfrow = c(1,2), cex = 0.7)
plot(template[[1]], type = "l", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Left hip: template 1")
plot(template[[2]], type = "l", xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Left hip: template 2")
```

```{r segm_lh2, eval = FALSE}
template <- list(stride_template$left_hip[[1]][1, ],
                 stride_template$left_hip[[2]][2, ])
x.lh <- acc_running$vm[acc_running$sensor_location == "left_hip"]
out1.lh <- segmentPattern(x = x.lh,
                          x.fs = 100,
                          template = template,
                          pattern.dur.seq = seq(0.5, 1.8, length.out = 50),
                          similarity.measure = "cor",
                          x.adept.ma.W = 0.05,
                          finetune = "maxima",
                          finetune.maxima.ma.W = 0.15,
                          finetune.maxima.nbh.W = 0.2,
                          compute.template.idx = TRUE,
                          run.parallel = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include=FALSE}
path.tmp <- "/Users/martakaras/Dropbox/_PROJECTS/R/adept/vignettes/static/results/out1_lh.csv"
# path.tmp <- "static/results/out1_lh.csv"
write.csv(out1.lh, path.tmp, row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
x.lh <- acc_running$vm[acc_running$sensor_location == "left_hip"]
path.tmp <- "static/results/out1_lh.csv"
out1.lh <- read.csv(path.tmp)
# out1.lh <- read.csv("/Users/martakaras/Dropbox/_PROJECTS/R/adept/vignettes/static/results/out1_lh.csv")
# out1.la <- read.csv("/Users/martakaras/Dropbox/_PROJECTS/R/adept/vignettes/static/results/out1_la.csv")
```

```{r}
head(out1.lh)
```

#### Results: estimated stride duration time

We now plot estimated stride duration in seconds (`T_i`/100) against estimated  stride start in minutes (`tau_i`/(100*60)). We firstly filter the results so as to keep only those which are *likely* corresponding to walking/running (not: resting). We also mark estimated resting/not-resting labels for subsequent 3-minute time windows which we obtained from $(vmc)$ data. 

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
## Merge results from two sensor locations, add resting/non-resting info
plt.df.la <- 
  out1.la %>% 
  merge(vmc.df.rest) %>%
  filter(tau_i >= vmc_tau_i, tau_i < vmc_tau_i + 3 * 100, resting == 0) %>%
  mutate(location = "left_ankle")
plt.df.lh <- 
  out1.lh %>% 
  merge(vmc.df.rest) %>%
  filter(tau_i >= vmc_tau_i, tau_i < vmc_tau_i + 3 * 100, resting == 0) %>%
  mutate(location = "left_hip")
plt.df <- rbind(plt.df.la, plt.df.lh)

ggplot(plt.df,
    aes(x = tau_i / (100 * 60) , y = T_i / 100)) + 
  geom_tile(data = vmc.df.rest, 
            aes(x = vmc_tau_i / (100 * 60), y = 1, fill = factor(resting)), 
            height = Inf, alpha = 0.1, inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  facet_grid(location ~ .) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 10) + 
  labs(x = "Exercise time [min]", y = "Estimated stride duration time [s]") + 
  theme(legend.position = "top") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("white", "blue")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = "grey90")) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 1.8))
```

##### Observations

* We observe the estimated stride duration (y-axis) is mostly consistent between the left ankle and left hip data. The small differences we observe between them may result from different $(vm)$ smoothing parameters used in tunning procedure for strides beggining and end  (left ankle: `finetune.maxima.ma.W = 0.05`, left hip: `finetune.maxima.ma.W = 0.15`). 
* Intuitively, it makes sense that around the resting periods (light blue shade), we observe strides of longer duration (the runner may be slowing down), or a short duration (the runner may be making short steps) before stopping etc. 


#### Results: subject-specific stride pattern (left ankle)

We now use the estimated stride occurrence start index (`tau_i`) and estimated stride duration (`T_i`) to retrieve $(vm)$ time-series segments corresponding to stride occurrences. We further align them in phase and scale to better observe stride patterns. 

```{r extract_subject_specific_sp, eval = FALSE}

  x.la.i <- x.la[out.i$tau_i : (out.i$tau_i + out.i$T_i - 1)]
  x.la.i.len <- length(x.la.i)
  if (var(x.la.i) < 1e-3) next
  ## For data frame #1 
  stride.acc.vec.la   <- c(stride.acc.vec.la, x.la.i)
  stride.tau_i.vec.la <- c(stride.tau_i.vec.la, rep(out.i$tau_i, x.la.i.len))

                     y = x.la.i,
                     xout = seq(0, 1, length.out = 200))$y
  x.la.i_S <- as.numeric(scale(x.la.i_S))
  stride_S.acc.vec.la <- c(stride_S.acc.vec.la, x.la.i_S)
  stride_S.tau_i.vec.la <- c(stride_S.tau_i.vec.la, rep(out.i$tau_i, 200))
  stride_S.phase.vec.la <- c(stride_S.phase.vec.la, seq(0, 1, length.out = 200))
}

## data frame #1 
stride.df.la <- data.frame(acc = stride.acc.vec.la, 
                           tau_i = stride.tau_i.vec.la,

                             phase = stride_S.phase.vec.la)
```

```{r plot_subject_specific_sp, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
## Plot segmented walking strides
plt1 <- 
  stride.df.la %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = idx/100, y = acc, group = tau_i)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.1) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 8) + 
  labs(x = "Stride pattern duration [s]", y = "Vector magnitude [g]",
       title = "Segmented walking strides")
plt2 <- 
  stride_S.df.la %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = phase, y = acc, group = tau_i)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.1) +

  labs(x = "Stride pattern phase", y = "Vector magnitude (scaled) [g]",
       title = "Segmented walking strides, aligned and scaled") 
grid.arrange(plt1, plt2, nrow = 1)
```

* From the plot of aligned and scaled strides (right hand side above), it seems there are at least two distinct stride patterns pronounced in data - one with a "spike with a dip" in a middle of a stride pattern phase, and another, less frequent (fewer lines on the plot), with a spike at approx. 2/3 of a stride pattern phase. 

##### Correlation clustering of segmented walking strides

We can further use correlation clustering to group segmented walking strides. 

```{r correlation_clustering, eval = FALSE}
## Compute strides distance martrix
stride_S.dfdc.la <- dcast(stride_S.df.la, phase ~ tau_i, value.var = "acc")[, -1]
data.mat.tau_i <- as.numeric(colnames(stride_S.dfdc.la))
data.mat <-  as.matrix(stride_S.dfdc.la)
D.mat  <- dist(cor(data.mat))

## Get cluster medoids
cluster.k <- 3
medoids.idx <- round(seq(1, ncol(stride_S.dfdc.la), length.out = cluster.k + 2))
medoids.idx <- medoids.idx[-c(1, medoids.idx + 2)]

## Cluster strides
pam.out <- cluster::pam(D.mat, cluster.k, diss = TRUE, medoids = medoids.idx)
table(pam.out$clustering)

## Put clustering results into data frame 
data.df <- as.data.frame(t(data.mat))
colnames(data.df) <- seq(0, to = 1, length.out = 200)
data.df$tau_i <- data.mat.tau_i
data.df$cluster <- pam.out$clustering
data.dfm <- melt(data.df, id.vars = c("tau_i", "cluster"))
data.dfm$variable <- as.numeric(as.character(data.dfm$variable))
data.dfm$cluster <- paste0("cluster ", data.dfm$cluster)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include=FALSE}
path.tmp <- "/Users/martakaras/Dropbox/_PROJECTS/R/adept/vignettes/static/results/data_dfm.csv"
# path.tmp <- "static/results/data_dfm.csv"
write.csv(data.dfm, path.tmp, row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
path.tmp <- "static/results/data_dfm.csv"
data.dfm <- read.csv(path.tmp)
# data.dfm <- read.csv("/Users/martakaras/Dropbox/_PROJECTS/R/adept/vignettes/static/results/data_dfm.csv")
```


```{r plot_correlation_clustering, fig.width=3.8, fig.height=5.7}
data.dfm.agg <- 
  data.dfm %>%
  group_by(variable, cluster) %>% 
  summarise(value = mean(value))
ggplot(data.dfm, aes(x = variable, y = value, group = tau_i)) + 
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_line(data = data.dfm.agg,  aes(x = variable, y = value, group = 1),
            color = "red", size = 1, inherit.aes = FALSE) +  
  facet_grid(cluster ~ .) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 9) + 
  labs(x = "Stride pattern phase", y = "Vector magnitude (scaled) [g]",
       title = "Segmented walking strides, aligned, scaled, clustered\nRed line: point-wise mean") 
```

We can further plot the estimated stride duration time over the course of the running exercise, marking the stride pattern cluster assignment with colour. 

```{r correlation_clustering_2, fig.width=7, fig.height=2.8}
data.dfm %>%
  select(tau_i, cluster)  %>%
  distinct() %>%
  left_join(plt.df.la, by = "tau_i") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tau_i / (100 * 60) , y = T_i / 100, color = cluster)) + 
  geom_tile(data = vmc.df.rest, 
            aes(x = vmc_tau_i / (100 * 60), y = 1, fill = factor(resting)), 
            height = Inf, alpha = 0.1, inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 9) + 
  labs(x = "Exercise time [min]", y = "Estimated stride duration time [s]",
       color = "Stride assignment: ",
       fill = "Resting: ") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("white", "blue")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = "grey90"))  + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 1.8))
```

##### Observations

* From the plot above we can note that stride pattern cluster assignment somehow corresponds to performed activity: strides marked with red *likely*  correspond to running, strides marked with green - walking with relatively long stride duration time, strides marked with blue - walking with a moderate stride duration time. 

### Segmentation with *Approach 2*: derive stride pattern templates manually

We now demonstrate a way of deriving stride patterns from data in a semi-manual way. The proposed procedure is done separately for data collected at two different locations, and goes as follows: 

1. Select short fragments of $(vm)$ time-series that are likely to represent data coming from different pace of running/walking. Here, we select two such $(vm)$ fragments, each of 6 seconds length. 
    
2. Within each of three $(vm)$ fragments, use a function to automatically identify *all* local maxima.

3. Within each of three $(vm)$ fragments, identify a *subset* of local maxima that corresponds to $(vm)$ peaks of interest via visual inspection ("manual" part). 

4. For each of three $(vm)$ fragments, cut the $(vm)$ fragment into parts at the points of identified local maxima subset. Interpolate parts to common a length and compute their point-wise average. The resulted point-wise average is a newly created pattern template. 

That way, for each sensor location, we arrive at three distinct stride pattern templates that we further use in segmentation. 

```{r}
## Function to compute local maxima
## source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6836409/finding-local-maxima-and-minima
localMaxima <- function(x) {
  y <- diff(c(-.Machine$integer.max, x)) > 0L
  rle(y)$lengths
  y <- cumsum(rle(y)$lengths)
  y <- y[seq.int(1L, length(y), 2L)]
  if (x[[1]] == x[[2]]) {
    y <- y[-1]
  }
  y
}

## Function which cut x vector at indices given by x.cut.idx,
## approximate cut parts into common length and average 
## parts point-wise into one vector
cut.and.avg <- function(x, x.cut.idx){
  x.cut.idx.l <- length(x.cut.idx)
  mat.out <- matrix(NA, nrow = x.cut.idx.l-1, ncol = 200)
  for (i in 1:(length(x.cut.idx)-1)){
    xp <- x[x.cut.idx[i]:x.cut.idx[i+1]]
    mat.out[i, ] <- approx(seq(0, 1, length.out = length(xp)), xp, seq(0, 1, length.out = 200))$y
  }
  out <- apply(mat.out, 2, mean)
}

## Make subset of data which has data parts of different speed of running
acc_running_sub2 <- 
  acc_running %>%
  filter((date_time >= t2 & date_time < t2 + as.period(6, "seconds")) | 
           (date_time >= t3 & date_time < t3 + as.period(6, "seconds")))  %>%
  mutate(dt_floor = floor_date(date_time, unit = "minutes"))
## Vector of signatures for data parts of different speed of running
dt_floor.unique <- unique(acc_running_sub2$dt_floor)
```

##### Deriving stride patterns in a semi-manual way: left ankle

```{r semi_manual_la, fig.width = 7, fig.height=2.3}
## Left ankle-specific subset of data  
sub.la <- acc_running_sub2[acc_running_sub2$sensor_location == "left_ankle", ]

plot(1:length(template.la.x1), template.la.x1, type = "l", 
     col = "red", main = "left ankle: template 1", xlab = "Index", ylab = "")

## Left ankle: template 2
x2 <- sub.la[sub.la$dt_floor == dt_floor.unique[2], "vm_smoothed1"]

template.la.x2 <- cut.and.avg(x2, x2.locMax[c(8, 18, 26, 37, 44)])
plot(1:length(template.la.x2), template.la.x2, type = "l", 
     col = "red", main = "left ankle: template 2", xlab = "Index", ylab = "")
## Template object

```


##### Deriving stride patterns in a semi-manual way: left hip

```{r semi_manual_lh, fig.width = 7, fig.height=2.3}
## Left hip-specific subset of data  
sub.lh <- acc_running_sub2[acc_running_sub2$sensor_location == "left_hip", ]

##### Observations

* From the plot above we see that the estimated stride duration times are fairly consistent between the two sensor locations, and also consistent with the estimates we obtained based on external, pre-computed stride pattern templates.
