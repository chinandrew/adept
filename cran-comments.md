## Other notes from the Maintainer

Dear Volunteer: thank you so much for your kind work on checking the package! Please find a few notes below. 

* Please note vignettes are extensive and yield 12 > 10 min package check time on CRAN. Hence, please kindly DISABLE VIGNETTE CHECKING for my package - an idea mentioned by Uwe Ligges in email thread 'CRAN submission adept 1.0.1' on May 13, 2019. 

    I think it is a good idea because: 

    * I believe the time it takes is generated by multiple moderately-lengthly examples, not: one-quite few lengthy parts results of which can be separated easily. 

    * I would really love the .Rmd file to be standalone and not relying on external results saves. 


    * I truly believe for vignette examples to fail, the tests suites should fail firstly. 

* There are NO references describing the methods in the package to be included in the Description field of the DESCRIPTION file as of now.
