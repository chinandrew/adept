# adept

`adept` package implements ADaptive Empirical Pattern Transformation (ADEPT) method for pattern segmentation from a time-series. ADEPT was designed for optimal use in performing fast, accurate walking strides segmentation from high-density data collected from a wearable accelerometer worn during continuous walking activity. 

### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("martakarass/runstats")
```


## Vignettes 

Vignettes are available to better explain package methods functionality. 

1. Vignette [Introduction to adept package](https://martakarass.github.io/adept/articles/adept-intro.html) intends to introduce a reader to the ADEPT method and demonstrate the usage of the `segmentPattern` function which implements ADEPT method. Here, we focus on illustrating `segmentPattern` functionality with a comprehesive set of simulated data examples.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="24%"}
knitr::include_graphics("inst/img/readme_art1_pic1.png")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("inst/img/readme_art1_pic2.png")
```


2. Vignette [Walking strides segmentation with adept](https://martakarass.github.io/adept/articles/adept-strides-segmentation.html) provides an example of walking stride segmentation from subsecond accelerometry data with `adept` package. We demonstrate that ADEPT method can be used to perform automatic and precise walking stride segmentation from data collected during a combination of running, walking and resting exercise. We demonstrate how to segment stride pattern: 

    (a) with the use of stride templates that were pre-computed based on data from an external study, 
    (b) by deriving new stride templates in a semi-manual manner.
